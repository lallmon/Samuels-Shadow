## Samuel's Shadow

Samuel's Shadow is a picture book about friends, one of whom may or may not be imaginary.

This was written as a a straight picture book, then mocked up as an interactive book in Keynote.

Finally I created an ePub 3.0 version, using the ePub schema and SMIL to sync the words to the audio. This is just the code repository, the art and audio assets are not stored in this repo.
